# Mobile Development Project Documentation

## 📱 Project Overview

KebunQ is a mobile application designed to assist home gardeners by leveraging image recognition technology to identify plant diseases in common crops such as grape, tomato, and cucumber. As gardening becomes increasingly popular, many enthusiasts struggle with diagnosing plant health issues, leading to crop failures and discouragement. Our solution allows users to upload images of affected plants, enabling accurate disease identification and treatment recommendations.
